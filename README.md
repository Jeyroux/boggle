# Boggle

The goal of this project is to describe the process of setting up a Github project and to demonstrate a boggle website.

## Setting up Github

- [x] Create a README.md file
- [ ] Set up Github
- [ ] Drag existing code into Github (created with the help of microsoft copilot)
- [ ] Describe how to run the Boggle project

## Boggle

- [x] Must have button which generates grid of boggle dice and starts the round (in existing code brought into Github)

If doing a timer and removing the need of using your own timer to play
- [ ] Must have a countdown timer (counting down from 3 minutes) which starts when the round starts, and ends the round once it reaches 0.

If doing keyboard inputs and removing the need for pen and paper for the user to play
- [ ] Must have the ability to check if a word is captured in the grid
- [ ] Must have the ability to check if a word is a valid english word
- [ ] Must have the ability to score words

If doing finger/mouse inputs and removing the need for a keyboard input to play
- [ ] Must have the ability to let the user drag their finger/mouse across the grid, instead of using a keyboard to input words
